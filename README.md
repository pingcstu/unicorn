# The Unicorn Project

**When AI can do anything for you, what will you build?**

## What Is This?

The Unicorn Project is a product incubator where you discover what to build, who to build for, and how to build it using AI. You will move from idea to deployed product through a structured curriculum and hands-on projects.

## The Three Questions

Before you build anything, answer these:

### 1. DELETE -- What problem are you actually solving?

Strip away assumptions. What is the real pain point? What would happen if this product did not exist? If nothing changes, the problem is not worth solving.

### 2. DISTORT -- What is your unique value?

Reframe the problem. What perspective do you bring that nobody else does? Your solution does not need to be better at everything -- it needs to be different in a way that matters.

### 3. GENERALIZE -- Who needs this and how will you deliver?

Identify your audience and your delivery mechanism. A great idea with no path to users is just a journal entry.

## Repo Map

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `curriculum/` | Your learning journey (start here) |
| `projects/agentic-landing-template/` | The build project (your hands) |
| `knowledge/` | Your thinking vault (your head, Obsidian) |
| `skills/` | AI agent patterns (power tools) |

## Managing Your Projects

Each project in `projects/` should be tracked in its own separate git repository. This gives you full control over visibility (public or private) for each project independently.

```bash
# 1. Add your project to .gitignore so it's not tracked by the parent repo
echo "projects/my-new-project/" >> .gitignore

# 2. Initialize and push to your own GitHub account
cd projects/my-new-project
git init
gh repo create my-new-project --private --source=. --push
```

Use `--private` for projects you want to keep private, or `--public` for open source projects.

## Getting Started

1. **Read** `curriculum/README.md` to understand the learning path
2. **Work through** the lessons in order
3. **Build** with `curriculum/04-build/` when you reach the hands-on phase

## For AI Agents

Agent behavioral instructions are in:
- `AGENTS.md` -- Master agent constitution
- `CLAUDE.md` -- Claude Code system prompt
- `GEMINI.md` -- Gemini CLI system prompt
