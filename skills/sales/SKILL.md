# Sales

## Core Principle

Sales isn't convincing people to buy something they don't want. It's finding people who already have the problem and showing them a better path.

## Founder-Led Sales → Scalable Engine

### The Four Stages

```
Stage 1: Founder closes every deal (0-10 customers)
  → Learn the sales motion, objections, and buying triggers

Stage 2: Founder + first hire (10-30 customers)
  → Document the playbook, hire someone to run it

Stage 3: Small team with process (30-100 customers)
  → Repeatable pipeline, CRM discipline, weekly metrics

Stage 4: Scalable engine (100+ customers)
  → Specialized roles (SDR, AE, CS), quota-based management
```

## Methodology Selection

### Match the Method to the Situation

| Situation | Methodology | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Complex enterprise, $50K+ ACV | MEDDIC | Multiple stakeholders, long cycles need qualification rigor |
| Quick SMB qualification, < $10K ACV | BANT | Fast yes/no decision on whether to pursue |
| Differentiated product, new category | Challenger | You need to teach buyers why the status quo is risky |
| Transactional, high volume | SPIN | Surface pain through questions, move fast |

### MEDDIC Framework (Enterprise)

```
M — Metrics: What's the measurable impact of solving this?
E — Economic Buyer: Who signs the check?
D — Decision Criteria: What are they evaluating on?
D — Decision Process: What are the steps to close?
I — Identify Pain: What specific pain drives this purchase?
C — Champion: Who inside will fight for you?
```

### BANT Framework (SMB)

```
B — Budget: Do they have money allocated?
A — Authority: Am I talking to the decision maker?
N — Need: Is the pain urgent enough to act?
T — Timeline: When do they need this solved?

Disqualify fast: If 2+ are missing, move on.
```

### Challenger Sale (New Categories)

```
1. Teach — Share an insight they didn't know about their problem
2. Tailor — Connect the insight to their specific situation
3. Take control — Guide the buying process, don't be passive
```

## Cold Outreach Sequences

### Email Sequence (5 touches over 14 days)

```
Day 1: Pain-based opener (no pitch)
  Subject: "[Specific pain point] at [Company]?"
  Body: 2-3 sentences about the problem. One question.

Day 3: Value proof
  Subject: Re: [previous subject]
  Body: "Company X solved this and saw [result]. Here's how."

Day 7: Different angle
  Subject: New subject line, different pain point or persona
  Body: Brief case study or metric. Soft CTA.

Day 10: Breakup preview
  Subject: "Should I close your file?"
  Body: "Seems like timing isn't right. Wanted to check before I stop reaching out."

Day 14: Breakup
  Subject: "Closing the loop"
  Body: "Moving on, but here's [resource] in case it's helpful later."
```

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Open rate | 40-60% | < 25% (subject lines need work) |
| Reply rate | 8-15% | < 5% (messaging or targeting issue) |
| Meeting booked rate | 3-5% of sequence | < 1% (revisit ICP or value prop) |
| Show rate | 80%+ | < 60% (confirmation flow broken) |

### LinkedIn Outreach (Parallel Track)

```
Day 0: View their profile
Day 1: Connect request (no note or very brief note)
Day 3: After connection, send a relevant insight (not a pitch)
Day 7: Share content relevant to their challenge
Day 10: Soft ask for conversation
```

## Pipeline Management

```
Stage        → Criteria to advance          → Probability
Prospecting  → Identified as ICP match      → 10%
Discovery    → Pain confirmed, stakeholder   → 20%
Evaluation   → Demo given, criteria met      → 40%
Proposal     → Pricing delivered             → 60%
Negotiation  → Terms under discussion        → 80%
Closed Won   → Signed                        → 100%
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Sales Theater | Real Sales |
|---------------|------------|
| "Let me show you our features" | "Tell me about [their problem]" |
| Pitching in the first email | Leading with insight or a question |
| "Following up" with no new value | Each touch adds a new angle or proof point |
| No CRM, deals in your head | Every deal tracked with stage and next action |
| Discounting to close | Selling value, walking away if fit isn't there |

## Power Move

"Design a complete outbound sequence for [ICP] selling [product at $X ACV]. Choose the right methodology (MEDDIC, BANT, or Challenger), write the 5-email sequence, define pipeline stages, and set the target metrics I should track weekly."

The agent becomes your sales architect — building a repeatable process, not just individual pitches.
