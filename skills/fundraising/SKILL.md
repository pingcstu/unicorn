# Fundraising

## Core Principle

VCs don't invest in ideas. They invest in returns. Understand their math and you'll understand their decisions.

## How VCs Actually Decide

Research shows VC evaluation priorities:

| Method | % of VCs Who Use It | Implication |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Cash-on-cash multiple | 63% | "Will this return 10x my check?" |
| IRR (Internal Rate of Return) | 42% | "How fast does the money come back?" |
| DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) | 10% | Almost nobody uses this for early-stage |

### What This Means for You

```
VCs think in portfolio math:
- Fund size: $100M
- Target return: 3x = $300M
- Typical portfolio: 20-30 companies
- Need 1-2 outliers returning 50-100x to make the fund work

Your job: Convince them you could be the outlier.
```

## The 10-Slide Pitch Deck (Sequoia/YC Hybrid)

| Slide | Purpose | Time |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1. Title | Company name, one-line description, your name | 10 sec |
| 2. Problem | The pain — specific, urgent, and expensive | 60 sec |
| 3. Solution | Your approach — demo or clear visual | 90 sec |
| 4. Market | TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up sizing | 60 sec |
| 5. Traction | Revenue, users, growth rate — the evidence | 60 sec |
| 6. Business model | How you make money, unit economics | 60 sec |
| 7. Competition | Positioning map — not a feature matrix | 45 sec |
| 8. Team | Why this team wins — relevant unfair advantages | 45 sec |
| 9. Financials | 18-month projection, use of funds | 45 sec |
| 10. Ask | Amount, milestones this capital unlocks | 30 sec |

### Slide-by-Slide Guidance

```
Problem slide: "X people spend Y hours/dollars doing Z because no one has built W."
  - Quantify the pain. Abstract problems don't get funded.

Traction slide: Show trajectory, not just a number.
  - "MRR: $5K → $15K → $40K over 3 months" beats "$40K MRR"

Market slide: Bottom-up, not top-down.
  - BAD: "The global SaaS market is $200B"
  - GOOD: "50K mid-market companies × $500/mo × 12 = $300M SAM"
```

## Outreach Hierarchy

Effectiveness ranked by actual conversion data:

```
1. Warm intro from portfolio founder     → 30-40% meeting rate
2. Warm intro from trusted VC            → 20-30% meeting rate
3. Warm intro from mutual connection     → 10-20% meeting rate
4. Cold email (well-researched)          →  3-5% meeting rate
5. Cold LinkedIn message                 →  1-2% meeting rate
6. Cold application through website      →  <1% meeting rate
```

### Warm Intro Request Template

```
To: [Mutual Connection]
Subject: Intro to [VC Name] at [Fund]?

Hi [Name],

Quick ask — would you be comfortable introducing me to [VC]?
We're raising a [seed/Series A] for [Company] — [one sentence description].

We have [key traction metric] and [VC Name] invests in
[relevant thesis match].

Happy to send a forwardable blurb if helpful. No pressure
if the timing doesn't feel right.

[Your name]
```

### Forwardable Blurb

```
[Company] — [one-line description]

- [Key metric 1: revenue, users, or growth rate]
- [Key metric 2: retention, NPS, or notable customer]
- Raising [$X] to [specific milestone]
- [Relevant background of founding team]

Deck attached. Happy to meet anytime this week.
```

## Fundraising Timeline

```
Week 1-2:  Build target list (40-60 investors), research thesis fit
Week 2-3:  Activate warm intros, send forwardable blurbs
Week 3-6:  First meetings (aim for 15-20 in a compressed window)
Week 4-7:  Partner meetings and deep dives
Week 6-8:  Term sheets and negotiation
Week 8-10: Close and wire
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Fundraising Theater | Real Fundraising |
|---------------------|------------------|
| "Taking meetings with anyone interested" | Targeting 40 investors with thesis fit |
| Raising before having any traction | Having 3+ months of growth data |
| Leading with the product | Leading with the market opportunity |
| Sharing 30-slide decks | 10 slides max, every word earns its place |
| "We have no competition" | "Here's why we win against [specific alternatives]" |
| Sequential outreach over 6 months | Compressed 3-4 week sprint for FOMO |

## Power Move

"Help me build a target investor list of 40 VCs for a [stage] raise in [sector]. For each, identify: thesis fit, check size, portfolio overlap, and the best warm intro path from my network. Then draft a forwardable blurb."

The agent becomes your fundraising strategist — mapping the shortest path from intro to term sheet.
