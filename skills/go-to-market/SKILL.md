Use when launching a product, choosing growth channels, or planning initial customer acquisition.

# Go-to-Market Strategy

## Core Principle

Distribution beats product. The best product nobody hears about loses to the average product with great distribution every time.

## Pre-Launch → First 100 Customers

### The Acquisition Ladder

```
Stage 1: Personal network (customers 1-10)
  → Founders selling 1:1, leveraging existing relationships

Stage 2: Community seeding (customers 10-30)
  → Targeted communities, content in niche forums, early adopter programs

Stage 3: Channel discovery (customers 30-100)
  → Test 2-3 channels, find the one that works, double down

Stage 4: Channel optimization (customers 100-1,000)
  → Systematize the winning channel, add one more
```

## B2C Growth Tactics (Lenny Rachitsky Research)

From studying 40+ successful companies:

| Growth Channel | Example Companies | How They Started |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Word of mouth | Slack, Dropbox, Figma | Built something people couldn't stop talking about |
| Virality (built-in) | WhatsApp, Venmo, Calendly | Product is better when you invite others |
| Content / SEO | HubSpot, Zapier, Canva | Created tools/content people search for |
| Paid acquisition | DoorDash, Instacart | Unit economics supported paid from day 1 |
| Community | Notion, Loom, dbt | Invested in user communities before scaling |
| Sales | Salesforce, Workday | High-touch enterprise from the start |
| Partnerships | Ramp, Plaid | Integrated into existing workflows |

### The First Channel Test

```
Spend 2 weeks on each of 3 channels.
Track: CAC, conversion rate, time to first value.
Kill channels where CAC > target within 2 weeks.
Double down on the channel with lowest CAC and fastest conversion.
```

## B2B Motion Selection

### Product-Led Growth (PLG) vs. Sales-Led

| Signal | PLG | Sales-Led |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| ACV | < $5K/year | > $25K/year |
| Buyer | End user | Executive / committee |
| Decision speed | Days | Weeks to months |
| Try-before-buy | Expected | Not always possible |
| Expansion | Usage-based upgrades | Contract negotiations |

### Decision Framework

```
Can a user get value in under 5 minutes without talking to anyone?
├── YES → Product-Led Growth
│   Examples: Slack, Notion, Figma
│   Playbook: Free tier → team adoption → enterprise upgrade
│
└── NO → Sales-Led (or Sales-Assisted PLG)
    Examples: Salesforce, Snowflake
    Playbook: Targeted outbound → demo → POC → contract
```

## Product Hunt Launch Playbook

### Pre-Launch (2 Weeks Before)

```
- Build a "hunter" relationship (top hunters get more visibility)
- Collect 200+ upvotes worth of supporters — email list, community, friends
- Prepare assets: 5 images, 240-char tagline, first comment with story
- Have a special launch offer ready
```

### Launch Day Timing

```
- Launch at 12:01 AM PT (Product Hunt resets daily at midnight PT)
- Post your "maker comment" immediately — tell the origin story
- Respond to every comment within 15 minutes for the first 4 hours
- Notify your supporters between 7-9 AM PT (prime upvote window)
- Share on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and communities throughout the day
```

### Post-Launch

```
- Day 2-3: Follow up with everyone who engaged
- Week 1: Email all upvoters with exclusive offer
- Week 2: Write a "lessons learned" post (content from launch → SEO)
```

## Racecar Growth Framework

### Three Growth Components

```
KICKSTARTS — One-time pushes that spike growth
  → PR hits, Product Hunt launch, conference talks, viral content
  → Valuable but not sustainable alone

ENGINES — Repeatable growth loops
  → SEO → content → traffic → signups (content engine)
  → User invites → new users → more invites (viral engine)
  → Revenue → paid ads → customers → revenue (paid engine)

TURBO BOOSTS — Optimizations that multiply existing engines
  → Conversion rate optimization
  → Referral program improvements
  → Onboarding flow tightening
```

### Apply the Framework

```
Most startups over-invest in kickstarts and under-invest in engines.

Priority order:
1. Get one engine working (even at small scale)
2. Use kickstarts to feed fuel into the engine
3. Apply turbo boosts once the engine is proven
```

## Anti-Patterns

| GTM Theater | Real GTM |
|-------------|----------|
| "We'll grow organically" | Choosing a specific channel and testing it |
| Launching on Product Hunt with no preparation | 2 weeks of community building first |
| Testing 10 channels simultaneously | Testing 3, killing 2, doubling down on 1 |
| "Our product is so good it sells itself" | Great products still need distribution |
| Waiting until the product is "ready" | Launching when it solves one problem well |

## Power Move

"Map out a 90-day GTM plan for [product] targeting [customer segment]. Identify the top 3 channels to test, design a 2-week experiment for each, and define the Racecar Growth Framework components: kickstarts for launch, the engine I should build first, and turbo boosts for month 3."

The agent becomes your growth strategist — building a repeatable acquisition engine, not just a launch moment.
