description: Validate startup ideas using the Kevin Hale/YC framework and Tom Bilyeu's 60-minute method—Mom Test interviews, GO/PIVOT/KILL decisions, and real founder case studies. Use when testing whether a problem is worth solving, designing customer interviews, or deciding whether to commit to an idea.

# Idea Validation

## Core Principle

The goal isn't to prove your idea is good. It's to find out how it's wrong before you waste six months building it.

## Kevin Hale / YC Validation Framework

Every startup idea must pass three gates:

```
1. PROBLEM — Is this a real problem people pay to solve?
2. SOLUTION — Does your approach solve it better than alternatives?
3. INSIGHT — What do you know that others don't?
```

### The Idea Matrix

| Dimension | Weak Signal | Strong Signal |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Problem frequency | "Sometimes annoying" | "Deal with this daily" |
| Existing solutions | "Nothing really" | "I cobbled together 3 tools" |
| Willingness to pay | "That would be nice" | "How much? When can I start?" |
| Urgency | "Eventually, maybe" | "I needed this yesterday" |

## Tom Bilyeu's 60-Minute Validation

Sprint through in one hour:

```
0:00–0:10  Write the problem in one sentence. If you can't, stop.
0:10–0:20  List 5 people who have this problem RIGHT NOW.
0:20–0:40  Contact 3 of them. Ask: "How are you solving this today?"
0:40–0:50  Identify what they hate about current solutions.
0:50–1:00  Write your unique insight — what you'd do differently and why.
```

## Mom Test Interview Scripts

The Mom Test (Rob Fitzpatrick): never ask if your idea is good. Ask about their life.

### Questions That Work

```
"Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem]."
"What did you do about it?"
"What else have you tried?"
"How much time/money does this cost you?"
"If you had a magic wand, what would you change?"
```

### Questions That Lie

| Bad Question | Why It Lies | Better Version |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| "Would you use this?" | People are polite | "How are you solving this today?" |
| "Would you pay $X?" | Hypothetical money isn't real | "What do you pay for [current solution]?" |
| "Do you think it's a good idea?" | They'll say yes to be nice | "What would make you switch from [current tool]?" |
| "How often do you have this problem?" | They'll exaggerate | "When was the last time this happened?" |

### Interview Structure

```
1. Anchor in reality: "Tell me about the last time..."
2. Go wide: "What else have you tried?"
3. Go deep: "Why didn't that work?"
4. Find the money: "What does this cost you in time/dollars?"
5. Close with commitment: "Can I follow up when we have something to show?"
```

## GO / PIVOT / KILL Decision Criteria

After 10+ interviews, score honestly:

### GO (Build It)
- [ ] 5+ people described the same core pain unprompted
- [ ] At least 2 offered to pay or sign a letter of intent
- [ ] You identified a clear insight competitors are missing
- [ ] You can build an MVP in under 4 weeks

### PIVOT (Change Direction)
- [ ] People have the problem but your solution misses the mark
- [ ] Adjacent problem surfaced repeatedly in interviews
- [ ] Market exists but your entry point is wrong
- [ ] Strong signal on "who" but weak signal on "how"

### KILL (Walk Away)
- [ ] Fewer than 3 out of 10 recognize the problem
- [ ] Everyone's "fine" with current solutions
- [ ] No willingness to pay or commit time
- [ ] Your insight isn't actually unique

## Case Studies

### Vanta (Compliance Automation)
```
Problem validated: Startups losing enterprise deals over SOC 2.
Signal: Founders said "I'd pay anything to not deal with this."
Insight: Compliance is repeatable → automate the evidence collection.
Validation method: Sold annual contracts before writing code.
```

### Flexport (Freight Forwarding)
```
Problem validated: Freight brokers using fax machines and spreadsheets.
Signal: Customers spending 10+ hours/week on manual tracking.
Insight: Software-first freight forwarding with real-time visibility.
Validation method: Manually brokered first shipments to learn the workflow.
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Validation Theater | Real Validation |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Survey with 1,000 strangers | 10 deep conversations with target users |
| "Everyone I asked loves it" | "3 people offered to pay before I built it" |
| Building MVP first, validating later | Validating the problem before writing code |
| Asking friends and family | Asking people who have the problem today |
| Counting sign-ups on a landing page | Measuring commitment: money, time, or reputation |

## Power Move

"Before I build anything, help me design a 5-question Mom Test interview for [target customer]. Then define GO/PIVOT/KILL criteria I should evaluate after 10 conversations."

The agent becomes your validation coach — structuring discovery so you learn the truth, not just what you want to hear.
